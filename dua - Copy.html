                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>I like photography, usually I take various scenes or objects when I'm traveling. I love sentimental, mysterious and dark photography. A photo that seems to speak like your heart. Which has a deep meaning. I also uploaded my photography results on Instagram. Besides photography I also like editing, usually I use editing applications like VSCO and Adobe Lightroom, I like to try various tutorials that I usually get on Twitter. In my opinion, this editing activity can train our design sense, because it can train to match colors and effects.</p>

                <h3>Editing</h3>
                <p>For editing I use VSCO and Adobe Lightroom which have their respective advantages. The effect I like is simple, simple and not too flashy. I like the effect that gives a deep impression to the photo but also beautiful when viewed. Vintage and BnW effects are good enough to be used to reflect this. However, there must be many settings in order to produce good photo editing. I also decorate my Instagram feed using the application with the results of my photo earlier. I use color style x BnW.</p>
