                <h3>Hobby</h3>
                <p>I have quite a number of hobbies, such as cooking, swimming, photography, editing, listening to music and learning new things. For hobbies like cooking and swimming, I usually do it on weekends. Photography when I'm traveling. Editing, listening to music and learning new things I do when I have nothing to do. I like a variety of music but from junior high school I like BMTH music, their music is good and uplifting but also deep.

                <h3>Interest</h3>
                <p>Right now I am interested in art and interior. I am happy when I see people attaching their work, such as paintings or pencil art to the walls of their rooms for decoration. I think I want to also study art. Besides that I also like coffee, therefore I want to try various kinds of processed coffee in cafes or try to make my own.</p>
